# Requirements

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to Automaticaly maintain tha Room Temperature and normalizing it .The project has been developed to carry out with different types of modes and can be done by automated or manually set the room temperature .The device feeds us the information about the temperature inside the room and sesnses the people whether they are present inside the room using motion detected sensor and turns the device to perform the climatic change.

## Research
Climate changes occurs for every seasons and during summer it would be so hot to stay  inside the room without the Air onditioner, And During Winter we dont need that in our room. So you have to buy a warmer to Warm the room , And this is'nt works automaticaly by sensing the room. So here by this project
both summer and winter which are very common are handled by this Automated Device Climate Contro, where you have the remote for your climate around you

The main goal of the project is to provide the user with every step of the device automated and with no error or defects , It also have a special feature of Reducing the Electricity bill than the AC


## Features
#### Mode Selection
#### Motion Sensor
#### Temperature Sensor
#### View all booking records
## Auto Turn ON and OFF
### Sense the temperature
#### Normalize According to it
#### A exhausht for Kitchen
#### User Friendly



### Defining Our System
### Explanation
Climate Control Device
      Select Mode
    * Auto TURN ON
    * Auto TURN OFF
    * Temperature reading
    * Display Temperature
      
    * Look for the Temperature    
    * Looks inside the room 
    * Displays the meassage about the temperature
    * Normalize the temperature
    * Turn OFF when no one is ther or Shutdown.
   


### 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who
### To People

## What
*   To bulid a automatic system to have the use to experince his own climate where he can control it

## When
*   When the user wants to change his room to a climate of his/her desire

## Where
*  This can be applied any where even in the home, office,theater,Kitchen,Hotels etc..,

## How
*   By creating and attaching the sensors within the device to compare and read the value of sensor and work autoomatically according it
